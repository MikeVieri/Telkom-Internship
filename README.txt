# Agreepedia Clone Project â€“ Automation Testing Scripts

This repository contains automation testing scripts developed using **Katalon Studio** and **Postman**, created during my internship as a QA Engineer at **Telkom Indonesia**.

The testing was performed on the *Agreepedia Clone Project*, focusing on both UI and API testing:

-  Katalon Studio: Used for UI automation testing (no-code object capture, test case creation, etc.)
-  Postman: Used for API testing (request validation, response checking, etc.)

These scripts were designed to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application during the development lifecycle.

**Note:** This project was part of my internship experience and reflects real-world QA practices in a professional setting.
